Python WMI Module - CHANGES
***************************

What is it?
===========

The Python WMI module is a lightweight wrapper on top of the pywin32
extensions, and hides some of the messy plumbing needed to get Python to
talk to the WMI API. It's pure Python and should work with any version of
Python from 2.1 onwards (list comprehensions) and any recent version of
pywin32.

What's Changed?
===============

15th Aug 2006 1.1.1  . Fixed a small bug reported and patched by Jonas Bjering
7th Apr 2006  1.1    . Removed redundant qualifiers method of _wmi_object (the
                       qualifiers are held as a dictionary member of the class).
                     . If a moniker is passed which doesn't start with winmgmts:
                       then add it automatically (this helps with associations).
                     . Special-cased associations, whose properties are the paths
                       of the associated classes: when the properties are requested,
                       automatically return the instantiated class.
2nd Mar 2006  1.0    . Final release for v1.0
                     . Corrected example in .new method of _wmi_namespace, 
                       deprecating the previous inappropriate example of
                       Win32_Process, and substituting Win32_ProcessStartup.
11th Feb 2006 1.0rc6 . Adjusted .set method so it won't try to .Put_ unless
                       the instance has a path (ie has not been spawned).
10th Feb 2006 1.0rc5 . Fixed small bug in .new method of _wmi_class
10th Feb 2006 1.0rc4 . Added from_time function to convert Python times to WMI
                     . Remove final Put_ from .new method as some classes are
                       not intended to be created (eg Win32_ProcessStartup).
                     . Add .put method to allow explicit instance creation.
                     . Allow user to prevent the namespace from searching for
                       valid classes at startup. This makes the startup
                       much faster, but means you don't get a list of classes.
29th Nov 2005 1.0rc3 . Small changes to allow array of output parameters
                     . Added qualifiers to list of private attributes
                     . Added details of required privs to method docstring
                     . Fixed long-standing bug in Usage example
                     . Added provenance to WMI methods from MappingStrings
26th Oct 2005 1.0rc2 . Corrected __repr__ in _wmi_namespace
18th Oct 2005 1.0rc1 . Refactored into namespace, class, object classes.
                     . This makes it easier to use certain things, such
                       as the StdRegProv's registry object, and the XP
                       SystemRestore functionality.
                     . Added CompareTo_ to support __eq__ functionality.
                     . Added username/password support to WMI connection.
                       Saves having to do separate connect_server call.
                     . Added optional debug flag to WMI connection.
                     . Switched to MIT license (GPL-compatible and
                       not Python-specific).
                     . Bumped version to 1.0
25th May 2005 0.6b   . Removed late-dispatch code (EnsureDispatch)
                       and replaced with dynamic dispatch, using
                       Thomas Heller's ProvideConstants class to
                       avoid hard-coding WMI constants. This is
                       to help people using py2exe who would
                       otherwise need to specify one or more
                       typelibs.
19th May 2004 0.6    . Added namespace support to wmi.__init__.
                       This means you can now do, eg:
                       wmi.WMI (namespace="MicrosoftIISv2")
                     . _wmi_method parameters now check for array
                       parameters, showing them on the __doc__ and
                       raising an exception if the value passed in
                       is not iterable.
17th Jan 2004 0.5    . Added support for the WMI Registry interface. The new
                       module-level Registry method returns a WMI registry
                       object whose methods include EnumKeys, CreateValue &c.
15th Dec 2003 0.4    . Added machines_in_domain (from a post to python-win32 by "Sean")
                     . Factored out moniker construction to make it easier to support
                       use of StdRegProv to update registry. (Coming soon).
                     . Added support for a timeout on the event watcher; timeout is
                       specified in milliseconds and raises x_wmi_timed_out on a
                       call to the watcher object. This allows for the possibility
                       of pumping for waiting messages to prevent eg, the PythonWin
                       IDE locking up. See the docstring for the watch_for method.
                     . Added connect_server function, making it slightly easier to
                       construct a WMI object, eg with username and password.
10th Jul 2003 0.3    . Changes by Paul Moore to allow a ready-made WMI Services
                       object to be passed in (WMI.__init__).
                     . This header and the __VERSION__ number added by Tim G.
 9th Jul 2003 0.2    . Sundry changes by Tim G, including but not limited to:
                     + support for moniker parts (WMI.__init__)
                     + creating new instances of WMI classes (WMI.new)
                     + passing return value back from wmi methods (_wmi_method.__call__)
                     + better COM error-handling (handle_com_error)
 5th Jun 2003 0.1    Initial release by Tim Golden
